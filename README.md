TherapyAI: Your Pocket Therapist (No Couch Required!)
TherapyAI is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide free, accessible, and supportive mental health assistance. Think of it as your 24/7 therapist, minus the awkward small talk about the weather. It leverages the Gemini 1.5 Flash language model to simulate empathetic and therapeutic conversations. The chatbot is built entirely using free tools and resources, making it an ideal project for hackathons or personal learning. (Yes, even broke college students can afford this therapy!)

Features
Conversational AI: Engage users in empathetic, supportive, and non-judgmental conversations. (No judgment here—unless you tell us you put pineapple on pizza. Then we might have to talk.)

Mental Health Support: Provide coping strategies, resources, and active listening. (We’re all ears—well, metaphorically speaking.)

Memory Retention: Retains context from previous conversations for coherent and context-aware responses. (We remember what you said last time, so no need to repeat yourself. Unless you want to. We’re here for you.)

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and accessible web-based interface. (No PhD required to use this bot.)

Privacy-Focused: No data storage or tracking of sensitive user information. (Your secrets are safe with us. Pinky promise.)

Free to Use: Built entirely with free tools and APIs. (Because therapy shouldn’t cost an arm and a leg. Or even a pinky toe.)

How It Works
TherapyAI uses the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate responses. It maintains a conversation history to provide context-aware replies. The chatbot is designed to simulate a therapeutic conversation, offering support and resources for mental health concerns. (Think of it as your virtual shoulder to cry on—minus the snot stains.)
